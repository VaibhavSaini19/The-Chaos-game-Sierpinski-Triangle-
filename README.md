Even though a Sierpinski triangle can be drawn using using continuous lines in Python Turtle graphics, an amazing approach is through the a game of probabilty.

The Chaos Game:
The game involves three dots and a die. The dots can be anywhere and just call them A, B and C. Then randomly put a starting point. Then all you are going to do is roll the die. If you get 1 or 2 you will go half way towards A, if you get 3 or 4 you will go half way towards B and if you get 5 or 6 half way towards C. After enough iterations the, you can start seeing a fractal, the Sierpinski Triangle.
